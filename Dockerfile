# The builder always runs on the build host's platform and cross-compiles a
# static musl binary for the requested target with zig as the C compiler and
# linker, so multi-platform builds need no emulation. The Rust version tracks
# rust-toolchain.toml (1.99). No `# syntax=` line: the Dockerfile frontend
# built into BuildKit covers everything used here, so no unpinned frontend
# image is pulled at build time.
